Checkers
===
Basic checkers setup, essentially just a heavily modded DrawShapes.
Click to select, arrow keys or menu to move. 
Kinged pieces are grey because I couldn't get shape layering down in time.
No 'ai' to play checkers against, find a friend
Beware, you can capture you're own pieces

Some notes:
* All the shape stuff is consolidated into Checker
* The panel and Scene have mild edits for the new purpose
* BoundingBox is the same
* Board is essentially just a modified version of drawShapes

TODO:
* Figure out a good system for mouse movement of pieces
* Get those crowns to work for royals so the bad color differentiation can be removed
* Implement a enemy algorithm
* Add a check so that you can't capture you're own pieces, maybe when the headache is gone
